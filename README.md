# Survival_Logistic_Regression

Problem Statement: The sinking of the Titanic is one of the biggest maritime disaster in the history, killing 1502 out of 2224 
passengers and the crew. One of the reasons for such loss was that there were not enough lifeboats. Some groups of people 
were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

Objective:
Use logistic regression to predict the survival of a given passenger based on features, such as sex, age
